Project C, also known as Clue.dicode, is a mysterious and immersive Android puzzle game that invites players into a world of riddles, encryption, and hidden truths. Designed to challenge how you observe, think, and interact with the world around you, each level unfolds a new layer of curiosity and mental exploration.

This isn't just a game - it's an interactive story where there are no rules... just clues.
