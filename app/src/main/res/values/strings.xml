    <!--  About Section  -->
    <string name="about_message">Welcome, explorer.\n
        You\'ve just stepped into a world where nothing is handed to you and everything is waiting to be discovered. This game isn\'t just about solving puzzles. It\'s about paying attention. About thinking differently. About seeing the hidden in the obvious. Each level has been designed to challenge your logic, twist your assumptions, and reward your curiosity.\n
        Behind every chapter lies a new encryption method, a new way of thinking. From ancient scripts to digital whispers, every clue tells a story but only if you know how to listen.\n\n
        <font size="20"><b><u>About Me</u></b></font>\n
        <font color="#1e1e1e">Bbcf\.\.\. jebat bar gel ntnva</font>\n
        I\'m Kumar Ansh, a Computer Science Engineering student who\'s endlessly fascinated by puzzles, ciphers, and the strange thrill of solving things no one else sees. This game started as a passion project - something small - but it quickly turned into a canvas for all the weird and clever things I\'ve learned (and loved) along the way.\n
        I didn\'t build this just to entertain, I built it to challenge you. To make you think, doubt, discover, and most of all, enjoy the process of getting stuck and then unsticking yourself. Every level is a piece of something I found cool, confusing, or just plain fun and now it\'s your turn to make sense of it.\n
        You don\'t need to be an expert. You just need to be curious.\n\n
        <font size="20"><b><u>One Last Thing\.\.\. <i>The Only Rule</i></u></b></font>\n
        <font color="#1e1e1e">Cdsvv robo\.\.\. sxdobocdsxq</font>\n
        There are no rules.\n
        Not really. Not here.\n
        You won\'t find walkthroughs or glowing arrows. There are no limits to how you solve what\'s in front of you.\n\n
        Use Google. Use your notes. Use the built-in browser. Type wildly. Guess boldly. Think sideways. Whether it takes you ten seconds or ten hours, what matters is how you get there, not how fast.\n
        If you\'re wondering what\'s allowed - the answer is\:\n
        <font color="#1e1e1e">Bwjpwopey</font>\n
        <i>Everything</i>.\n\n
        Thanks for playing.\n
        Now go break things.\n
        - Kumar Ansh\n\n
        Oh, and if you\'re here looking for the developer\'s username\.\.\.
        Nice try. This isn\'t the place. 😉</string>

        P.S. You\'re not bound by rules here. The answers are out there, use Google, search far and wide. There\'s even a browser waiting for you in the bottom-right corner. Tap into it. Uncover what\'s hidden.</string>

        P.S. If anything feels important, write it down, there\'s a built-in notes tool in the bottom-left corner, made just for that. And remember, you\'re never alone in this Google is your silent companion, ready when you are.</string>

        Prepare to twist symbols, shift meanings, and unlock what others overlook.\n

        You\'ve proven you can decipher the past, but now it\'s time to navigate the present. This chapter steps beyond the walls of this game and into a place far more dangerous: <b>The Open Web.</b>\n
        In this realm, power lies in knowing how to search, not what you search for.\n
        What you\'re about to learn is called Google Dorking - the art of bending search engines to your will, unlocking hidden corners of the internet that most never see. Precision is your greatest weapon now.\n
        Your first task is simple\.\.\. or so it seems.\n
        You\'ll be given a link - an image. Your goal?\n
        <b>Find the name of the city it reveals.</b></string>

    <string name="level_description_2.2">So, you\'ve found a city from an image\.\.\. impressive.\n
        But the web hides more than just geography - it holds architecture, identity, and secrets carved in stone.\n
        Now it\'s time to look inside.\n
        The image you\'re given isn\'t just a photograph - it\'s a footprint, a whisper from the walls.\n
        Every curve, every shadow, every pattern\.\.\. it all points somewhere.\n\n
        Your task:\n
        <b>Find the name of the building.</b>\n\n
        Don\'t just look. Investigate.</string>

    <string name="level_description_2.3">You\'ve learned how to trace locations and decode buildings. But now, let\'s shift the lens.\n
        The story doesn\'t always lie in what\'s seen - sometimes, it\'s in who captured it.\n
        This time, the image you\'re given holds more than just scenery.\n
        Behind the frame is a pair of eyes\.\.\. a name\.\.\. a trace waiting to be found.\n
        Search carefully - the credit belongs to someone.\n\n
        Your task:\n
        <b>Find the photographer of this image.</b>\n\n
        The image speaks. You just have to ask the right questions.</string>

    <string name="level_description_2.4">No image this time. No faces. No buildings. Just two numbers\.\.\.\n
        Cold. Silent. But not meaningless.\n
        Numbers have weight. They carry history, identity, context.\n
        And these? They\'re tied to a person. Somewhere out there, someone\'s name is stitched into them.\n\n
        Your task:\n
        <b>Uncover the first name.</b>\n\n
        You\'ve asked the web questions before.\n
        Now it\'s time to ask:\n
        What do these numbers mean\.\.\. and who do they belong to?\n\n
        And with that, Chapter 2 draws to a close.\n
        But remember - knowledge is scattered, not hidden. You just have to know where to look.</string>
